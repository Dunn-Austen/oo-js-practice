# OO JavaScript Practice

Each exercise emphasizes the fundamentals of object oriented programming in JavaScript.

## Installation Steps

1. Run `npm install`
2. Test that the unit tests are working: Run the command `npm test objects-and-functions/test/student-test.js` in your terminal

You should see something like:

```shell
> foundations@1.0.0 test /Users/robbie/turing/front-end/1mod/oo-js-practice
> mocha "objects-and-functions/test/student-test.js"

Student
  1) should be a function
  2) should have a name
  3) should have an age
  4) should start with no scores
  5) should be able to log scores
  6) should calculate average score

  0 passing (6ms)
  6 pending
```

## Practice Time

Un-skip a test, read the contents of it, and predict why it will fail. Fail the test. Read the error, and evaluate if you were accurate in your prediction. Make the test pass! Repeat.

Pass tests in the following order:

- student
- gradebook
